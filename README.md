# Website-Searcher

## Requirements

Given a list of urls in urls.txt: https://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldlens-public/urls.txt, write a program that will fetch each page and determine whether a search term exists on the page (this search can be a really rudimentary regex - this part isn't too important).

You can make up the search terms. Ignore the addition information in the urls.txt file.

Constraints
Search is case insensitive
Should be concurrent.
But! It shouldn't have more than 20 HTTP requests at any given time.
The results should be writted out to a file results.txt
Avoid using thread pooling libraries like Executor, ThreadPoolExecutor, Celluloid, or Parallel streams.
The solution must be written in Go or Java.

Sample urls.txt: https://s3.amazonaws.com/fieldlens-public/urls.txt

The solution must be able to be run from the command line (dont assume JDK is available):
java -jar ./jarFileName.jar
go run main.go
